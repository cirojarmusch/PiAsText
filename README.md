Ï€ is an irrational number, it has infinite non-periodic decimal digits. This is what happens if we take the first million decimal places of pi and replace it with letters or symbols. If we were able to do this with the infinite number of decimal places, we would find in the resulting text the complete text of "Don Quixote" and of any text ever written or to be written.
